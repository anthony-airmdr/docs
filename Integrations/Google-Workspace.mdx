    GCP is hierarchical, so we must first create a project. If you already have a GCP environment set up, we recommend following similar steps below to create a new project that links to your Google Workspace via the registered domain.

    1. Go to Google Cloud Console.

       <Note>
         Sign in with your Google account used to set up Google Workspace.
       </Note>
    2. Click on the **project selector** (top-left dropdown near “Google Cloud”).
    3. Click **"New Project"** to configure the project with all the necessary details:
       - **Project Name**: Enter a unique name for your project (For example: AirMDR).
       - **Organization & Location**: Choose [airmdr.com](http://airmdr.com) or your organization (if applicable) or "No organization" for personal use.
    4. Click **Create**.
