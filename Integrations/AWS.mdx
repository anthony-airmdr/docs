### **Setup AWS**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable AWS GuardDuty">
    1. Go to your AWS account.
    2. Open the **GuardDuty console**: [AWS GuardDuty Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/).
    3. In the **GuardDuty dashboard**, click **"Enable GuardDuty"**.
    4. Choose whether to enable GuardDuty for:
       - Your **current AWS account** (for a single account setup).
       - **Multiple accounts** using AWS Organizations (if managing various accounts).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up an S3 Bucket for Log Storage in AWS">
    1. Go to S3 Console: [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)
    2. Click **"Create bucket"**.
    3. Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `my-security-logs-bucket`).
    4. Choose the **AWS Region** where you want to store logs.

       <Note>
         Make sure it is in the same region where GuardDuty is enabled.
       </Note>
    5. Click **"Create bucket"**.
    6. Configure the bucket with appropriate policies and permissions to allow GuardDuty to write logs to it.
    7. Attach a bucket policy that grants GuardDuty permission to write logs to the bucket.\
       Example Policy

       ```
       
       {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Principal": {
                      "Service": "guardduty.amazonaws.com"
                  },
                  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Principal": {

                  "Action": "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name"
              }
          ]
       }
       
       ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure a KMS Key Policy for AWS GuardDuty">
    AWS **KMS (Key Management Service)** is used to encrypt findings stored in Amazon S3 or other services.

    1. Open the **AWS KMS Console** → [KMS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/home).
    2. Select an existing KMS Key.\
       **or**
    3. Click **"Create Key"**.
    4. Select the **Symmetric** key.
    5. Choose **Encrypt and Decrypt** as the key usage.

    8. Add AWS GuardDuty service permissions to use your key
       - Copy the following policy block and add it to the Statement list in your KMS key policy

         ```
         
         {
                     "Sid": "Allow GuardDuty to use the key",
                     "Effect": "Allow",
                     "Principal": {
                         "Service": "guardduty.amazonaws.com"
                     },
                     "Action": [
                         "kms:Encrypt",
                         "kms:Decrypt",
                         "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                         "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                         "kms:DescribeKey"
                     ],
                     "Resource": "*"
                 }
         ```
    9. Review & click **Create Key**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable GuardDuty Findings Export to Amazon S3">
    **Pre-requisites**

    <Check>
      Ensure **GuardDuty is enabled** in your AWS account.
    </Check>
    <Check>
      An **Amazon S3 bucket** exists for storing findings
    </Check>
    <Check>
      Proper **IAM permissions** for GuardDuty to write to the S3 bucket.
    </Check>
    1. Go to your [AWS GuardDuty Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/).
    2. In the settings, enable the export of findings to your S3 bucket.
    3. Specify the S3 bucket ARN and KMS key ARN of the same region.

       <Warning>
         Issues you can run into:
         - Principal did not have access to the KMS key.
       </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up an IAM Role for API Access in AWS">
    If you need to grant **secure API access** to AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda, or third-party applications), you must create an **IAM role** with the right permissions.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an IAM Role">
        - **Sign in** to the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
        - Click on **Roles** in the left navigation panel.\
          ![AWS6 Pn](/images/AWS6.png)
        - Click the **Create role** button.\
          ![AWS7 Pn](/images/AWS7.png)
        - **Select a trusted entity**:
          - If AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) need API access → Choose **AWS Service**.
          - If a third-party app needs access → Choose **Web Identity or OpenID Connect**.
          - If another AWS account needs access → Choose **Another AWS Account**.

            <Info>
              AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege security credentials for IAM users or federated users. These temporary credentials can be used to access AWS resources securely without creating long-term IAM credentials.
            </Info>
            - Enter the **Account ID**: **<u>242133657058</u>** only as an identifier of the account that can use this role.\
              ![AWS8 Pn](/images/AWS8.png)

              <Info>
                Generally, the Account ID is a 12-digit Number, use only the Account ID mentioned above.
              </Info>
              <Tip>
                To enhance the Security:
                1. Specify an External ID, a unique identifier that the trusted account must provide when assuming the role
                2. To add an external_id:
                   - Select the **Require an external ID** checkbox.
                   - Enter the unique agreed-upon external ID value.
                   - Do NOT check "**Require MFA**" unless the assuming account needs MFA.
              </Tip>
        - Click **Next**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Attach API Permissions">
        - Choose a predefined **AWS Managed Policy** or create a custom one:
          - **Full API Access** → `AdministratorAccess` (Not recommended for security).
          - **Read-Only API Access** → `ReadOnlyAccess`.
          - **GuardDuty API Access** → `AmazonGuardDutyFullAccess`.
        - Click **Next.**
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review and Create the Role">
        1. Provide the required information in the **Role details** section for the role.
           - **Role Name** – Provide a meaningful name like `AirMDR`.
           - **Description** (Optional) – Add a short description for this role.

             ![AWS9 Pn](/images/AWS9.png)
        2. Review your selections (Permissions and Policies), and if everything is correct.
           - **Review Permissions** – Ensure the attached policies meet your security needs.
           - **Review Trust Policy** – Verify the trust policy when you use cross-account access or service.
        3. Click **Create Role**.

           <Warning>
             Securely save and share these credentials with the AirMDR operations team to allow monitoring.
           </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Retrieve the Role ARN (Amazon Resource Name)">
        Once the role is created:

        1. Click on the role name.
        2. Copy and securely save the **Role ARN** (Amazon Resource Name).\
           ![AWS10 Pn](/images/AWS10.png)

           <Warning>
             Securely save and share these credentials with the AirMDR operations team to allow monitoring.
           </Warning>
      </Step>
