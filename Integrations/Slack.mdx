### Evaluate Slack Webhook URL

Open **cURL** and run the following command to check if your API Key is working:

```

POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Content-type: application/json
{
    "text": "Hello, Slack."
}
```

<Note>
  Replace the URL with the Slack Webhook URL generated earlier.
</Note>

Response:\
Go to the channel your app was installed into, and you will see that the "Hello, Slack" message has been posted by your app.

<Warning>
  Webhook URL contains a secret. Do not share it online, including via public version control repositories. **Slack actively searches out and revokes leaked secrets.**
