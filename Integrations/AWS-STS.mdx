### **Setup AWS Security Token Service (STS)**

Setting up AWS STS typically involves assuming roles securely across different AWS accounts or services. Here’s how you can set it up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable AWS STS">
    AWS STS is enabled by default for most AWS Regions. However, you can verify or enable it through the AWS Management Console:

    1. **Sign in** to the AWS Management Console →  [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
    2. Click on **Account Settings**.
    3. Check if AWS STS is enabled for the necessary regions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an IAM Role for STS">
    1. Go to the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
    2. Click on **Roles** in the left navigation panel.\

    5. In An AWS account → **Another AWS account**, enter the **Account ID**: **<u>242133657058</u>** only as an identifier of the account that can use this role.

       <Info>
         Generally, the Account ID is a 12-digit Number, use only the Account ID mentioned above.
       </Info>
       <Tip>
         To enhance the Security:
         1. Specify an External ID, a unique identifier that the trusted account must provide when assuming the role
         2. To add an external_id:
            - Select the **Require an external ID** checkbox.
            - Enter the unique agreed-upon external ID value.
            - Do NOT check "**Require MFA**" unless the assuming account needs MFA.
       </Tip>
    6. Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach Policies (Permissions)">
    1. Choose the policies that grant permissions to the role.\
       or
    2. You can create a **custom policy** if no predefined policy meets your requirements.
    3. Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Create the Role">
    1. Provide the required information in the **Role details** section for the role.
       - **Role Name** – Provide a meaningful name like `AirMDR`.
       - **Description** (Optional) – Add a short description for this role.\

    2. Review your selections (Permissions and Policies), and if everything is correct.
       - **Review Permissions** – Ensure the attached policies meet your security needs.
       - **Review Trust Policy** – Verify the trust policy when you use cross-account access or service.
    3. Click **Create Role**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve the Role ARN (Amazon Resource Name)">
    Once the role is created:

    1. Click on the role name.
    2. Copy and securely save the **Role ARN** (Amazon Resource Name).\
