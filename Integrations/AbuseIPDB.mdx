### Generate AbuseIPDB API

You will need an API key to interact with the Rapid7 InsightAppSec API.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access AbuseIPDB Platform">
    1. Go to the [Rapid7 Insight Platform](https://insight.rapid7.com/).
    2. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) at the page's top right corner.
    3. From the dropdown menu, select "**API Keys**".
    4. Choose the Type of API Key (User Key or Organization Key) to Generate:
       - **User Key:** Represents your user account and inherits your account’s permissions. All users can generate a User Key.
       - **Organization Key:** This key represents the entire organization and provides comprehensive access across all products. Only platform or organization administrators can generate an Organization Key.
    5. Click **Generate**.
       - For a **User Key**:​
         - Click on "New User Key."
         - In the "Generate New User Key" panel, select your organization and provide a descriptive name for the key.
         - Click "**Generate**".
       - For an **Organization Key**:​
         - Click on the "Organization Keys" tab.
         - Click "New Organization Key."
         - In the "Generate New Organization Key" panel, select the organization and provide a descriptive name for the key.
         - Click "**Generate**".

       <Warning>
         Copy and securely save the generated **API token** (it won’t be shown again).
       </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine Data Storage Region">
    <Info>
      Each region has specific endpoints that your network must communicate with.
    </Info>
    <Tip>
      Ensure your network allows outbound connectivity to these hostnames over TCP port 443.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Associate the UUID with Your API Key">
    Since Rapid7 does not natively provide UUIDs for API keys, you can:

    - Store the API key and UUID mapping in your internal **configuration files** or **database**.
    - Use the UUID as an identifier when logging API calls for tracking purposes.

    To get the **UUID** of an asset, use the following API call:

    ```
    
    curl --location 'https://{region}.api.insight.rapid7.com/idr/v2/investigations' \
    --header 'X-Api-Key: {API Key}' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
