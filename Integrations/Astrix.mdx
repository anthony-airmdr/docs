### Astrix's OAuth 2.0 authentication system Integration

To integrate your application with Astrix's OAuth 2.0 authentication system, you will need to obtain specific credentials and endpoints:​

1. **Auth URL**: The URL where users are directed to authorize your application.​
2. **Base URL**: The root URL for Astrix's API endpoints.​
3. **Client ID**: A public identifier for your application, provided when you register your app with Astrix.​
4. **Client Secret**: A confidential key used alongside the Client ID to authenticate your application.​
5. **Audience**: Identifies the intended recipient(s) of the access token, ensuring it's used for the correct API.​

### Generate Astrix OAuth 2.0 authentication credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register Your Application with Astrix">
    1. Go to Astrix [developer Portal](https://astrix.security/).
    2. Provide the required details about your application
       - Name of the application,
       - Description of the application,
       - Website URL.​
    3. Upon successful registration, Astrix will issue
       - **Client ID**
       - **Client Secret**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine the Auth URL and Base URL">
    1. The **Auth URL** is typically provided in Astrix's OAuth 2.0 documentation. It's the endpoint where users will authenticate and authorize your application.​
    2. The **Base URL** is the root endpoint for Astrix's APIs. This is also usually specified in their API documentation.​
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the Audience">
    1. The **Audience** parameter ensures that the access token is intended for the correct API.​
    2. Astrix's documentation will specify the expected audience value. It's often a URL or URI identifying the API resource.​
    3. When making authorization requests, include the audience parameter to specify the intended recipient of the token.​
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Evaluate Auth Token with credentials

Open **cURL** and run the following command to check if your API Access is working:

**Example cURL request:**

```

curl -X POST "https://<your_auth_url>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "audience": "YOUR_AUDIENCE"
  }'
```
